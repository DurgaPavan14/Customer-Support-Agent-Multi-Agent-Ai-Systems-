Multi-Agent Customer Support Ticket Resolution System

This project simulates a team of AI agents working together to process and respond to a customer support request. Built using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), the system models a real-world customer support workflow with distinct roles, message passing, and clear outputs.

Objective
Automate the process of responding to customer queries using multiple AI agents that collaborate in a step-by-step pipeline.

Agent Roles

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Collector Agent | Receives the customer query and structures it for processing |
| Classifier Agent | Tags the issue (Billing, Technical, or General) |
| Responder Agent | Drafts a professional reply using the classified data |
| Reviewer Agent | Reviews and polishes the message for clarity and tone |

Workflow
Customer Message → Collector → Classifier → Responder → Reviewer → Final Response
